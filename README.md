# Extract_Code_From_Video

## Dependencies

- pytesseract (Install Tesseract previously)

- opencv-python

- python -m pip install git+https://github.com/zepedroc/pytube.git

### TODO

- Make an API out of this
- Separate Coding Lang from Text Language
- Improve Performance: Maybe use threads to process the video in multiple ways and return the result with more characters
